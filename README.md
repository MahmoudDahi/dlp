We developed a Python-based DLP (Data Loss Prevention) tool that automatically scans all Excel files within a specified hard partition. Using regex patterns, it identifies sensitive data such as ID numbers and credit card numbers. Upon detection, the tool promptly sends an email alert to our SOC (Security Operations Center) manager. This ensures continuous monitoring and proactive response to potential data security breaches.
